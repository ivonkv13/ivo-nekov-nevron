Interview task for Nevron


#requirements:

The page has 3 buttons:

Clear Numbers – clears all numbers on the server side and updates the client side number items and count.

Add Number – adds a random number in the session state and updates the client side.

Sum Numbers – goes to the server, finds the sum of the items, and updates the client side Numbers Sum

Essential Requirements:

All calculations and operations are performed on the server – the client is simply kept synchronized with the server state.

The list is stored in the session state so that it is persistent across multiple tabs of the browser.

Client site updates are performed only for the areas where an update is needed.
